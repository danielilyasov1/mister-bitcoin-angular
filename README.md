# MisterBitcoinAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

In this app, you can signup and look at the graph indicators that are updated live with APIs.

Also, we have all the CRUDL with the contacts and the ability to search them.

And of course to transfer them some Bitcoins (don't worry it's just a demo).
